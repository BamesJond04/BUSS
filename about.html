    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>We are the Bristol University Swing Society (BUSS)! 
        Swing dancing is a type of social partnered dance that originated in African American communities 
        during the 1920s and 30s and encompasses a group of different dances including Lindy hop, Charleston 
        and Balboa. A six or eight count footwork basic is used as the general idea, but we love how improvisational 
        and relaxed this dance is! Swing is generally danced to jazz music, often to live jazz bands. 
        We run weekly swing dancing sessions including a beginners and intermediate class, so there's something for everyone no dancing background necessary!</p>

    <p>We will also be running regular socials, including nights out, cafe trips, formals, and family socials, so sign up for a good time all year round!</p>

    <p>Hope to dance with you soon!</p>
